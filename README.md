# CPU-Scheduling-Simulation
CPU scheduling simulation using java, Multilevel Feedback Queue implemented using 3 Queues using RR round Robbin algorithm and First Come First Serve (FCFS) algorithm.

## Implementation:
- Multilevel Feedback Queue:
  >> Queue 1: RoundRobbin (RR), quantum = 8 .
  >> Queue 2: RoundRobbin (RR), quantum = 16.
  >> Queue 3: First Come First Serve (FCFS).

- CPU will serve Queue 1 by 50%
- CPU will serve Queue 2 by 30%
- CPU will serve Queue 3 by 20%
- Promotion or Demotion is done by randomness of 50%
- Assumed CPU time = 160 (a number it's 50% is multiple of 8 and it's 30% is mul;tiple of 16)
- I generate 100 random pocesses each has ID and burst time
